### My Python personal work, which is basically related to Data Science and Machine Learning

- Basic Tensorflow Project - Use Tensorflow Contrib.learn module and a DNN classifier to verify the authentication of the banks notes

- NLP Project - Predict Yelp star reviews from the comments of users. We use the classifiers from Scikit-Learn (Multinomial Naive Bayes & SVM) and some text preprocessing techniques (Bag of words and Tf-Idf transformer) in this task.
